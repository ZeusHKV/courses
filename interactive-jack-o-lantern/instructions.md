# The project 
The goal of this project is to introduce basic concepts of IoT embedded programming through a seasonal and rather amusing angle. 

The idea is to make a jack-o-lantern controlled via twitter. Commands sent to a specific twitter account allow to change the color
of the light inside the pumpkin or perform a pre-defined animation such as opening the pumpkin or playing a spooky sound effect. 
A range sensor allows to trigger an action sequence if someone gets close to the jack-o-lantern. Finally a sound sensor can be used
to modulate the light according the the surrounding sound level.
